# Learn Spring
Learning the Spring framework for Java.

## Requirements
- JDK 1.8
- Spring 5
- Maven >= 3.2

## Recommendations
- Eclipse >= Photon 4.8.0

## Cautions
- Some projects may not work running out of Eclipse because Eclipse is using the built-in Maven which is version 3.5.x. Not sure why that is causing an issue. In those cases, try running using command line as that will use the installed Maven which is at 3.3.3.
- To get the maven wrapper to work, the project should be located in a path that contains no spaces, otherwise it will complain about unexpected files.
